# Procurement Process Example (Construction Materials)

## Context
Procurement of construction materials for ongoing projects. The goal is to purchase required items with minimal delays, controlled price, and compliant approval workflow.

## Participants
- Site engineer / requester
- Procurement specialist
- Supplier / contractor
- Finance department
- Commercial director / business owner
- Accounting

## Inputs
- Request from site (items, specs, quantities, deadlines)
- Budget limits / cost center
- Existing supplier list and contract terms (if any)

## Documents
- Request / purchase requisition
- Technical specification (TS) / requirements
- Commercial offers (CP)
- Approval sheet / routing
- Contract / addendum
- Invoice + delivery note (closing documents)

## Process Steps
1. Request is created and validated (mandatory fields, deadlines, cost center).
2. Procurement collects commercial offers (2–5 suppliers).
3. Offers are compared (price, delivery time, quality, terms).
4. Approval workflow (procurement → finance → commercial director).
5. Purchase order / contract is issued and sent to supplier.
6. Delivery is received and checked against request and documents.
7. Accounting closes the transaction (invoice, delivery note, payment).

## Pain Points / Bottlenecks
- Manual consolidation of offers in Excel / messengers
- Multi-level approvals cause delays
- Missing request fields lead to rework
- No unified criteria for offer evaluation
- Poor visibility of status (who is blocking, SLA)

## Risks
- Delays in procurement and project schedule slip
- Overpayment due to weak benchmarking
- Non-compliant purchase without proper approval
- Supplier reliability / quality risk
- Excess stock or shortages

## Desired Output
- Faster approvals with transparent routing and SLA
- Standardized offer comparison criteria
- Automation ideas (Level 1–3) with ROI hypotheses
